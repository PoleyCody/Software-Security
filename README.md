# Software-Security

•	Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial wants the most current and update software security to protect their web-based software application. The company handles financial information of other clients and needs the API to be well protected from outside sources due to this the value of this security communications are a high priority. The company deals with investments there for the company could deal with international transactions.

•	What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

In this project the company wanted me to find vulnerabilities in the system and then tell them how to solve them. I personal feel I did a good job finding the problems and solving them for the company. The reason it is import to code securely is to protect not just the company but their clients from attacks from hackers. Software security adds peace of mind for the company and their clients and allows the company to have more sensitive information secured.  

•	What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

The part of the process I found challenging was getting Maven up and running once I figured out where to put the plugin for Maven in the pom file it was easy. However, during the process the dependency check the program didn’t want to load the HTML, but I found that my firewall was blocking it, so I had to turn off my firewall to access it.

•	How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

When approaching the need to increase layers of security, I look at what is the need for the system and for the company. I then look at the hardware being used, and the software used in the product. Using this information, I then create a plan looking at the threats and vulnerabilities in the system. 

•	How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

To ensure that the code and software application were secure I used the Maven plugin to find the problems in the program. After fixing the problems found by using the Maven plugin, I then ran the program again to see if new problems where found. If there where new problems I repeat the check tell no problems were found in the program.

•	What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

The resource I used to find the problems in the programs was the Maven plugin which helped me find the problems and solutions to those problems. I plan to use Maven plugin whenever writing Java programs to ensure that my programs are up to date and secure allowing me to create better programs in the future.

•	Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

If I was to show an employer any part of this assessment, I would show how I found the problems in the software. I would then show the employer how knowing the problems in the program is half the battle and using this information can help protect the client’s information.
